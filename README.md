# Hi 
##### This is Rafioul Hasan Sourob.I am explaing here The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.These two are advance type construct in typescript.At first i will discribe about union type.
- Union type:
  It's very simple to understand what union type does.But it contain a great power & give us the scope to use of it.It's like a or operator we can use there when have we use  multiple type accumulate in one type.Some time use declare some type while we do coding and some we havta implement all of or most of type in one function .then we usually use Union.It's a great example of reuse code.It give us optins.
- Intersection type:
Intersection type is another example of reuse code.It's usually use for concatenate two types.It usually sum two type we use.Where it use the block have to fullfil all of the given conditions.then the code will be execute.Whatever the two type made our code efficent and powerful so it contain a great importance.
